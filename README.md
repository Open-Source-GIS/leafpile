Leafpile
===========

A marker clustering layer for Leaflet maps.  Markers are grouped together based on pixel-distance from each other at a particular zoom level.  As the map zooms in and out, groups are recomputed.  Image assets are base64-encoded into the javascript file, so there's no need to host images/stylesheets.

There's a demo [available here](http://cav.is/leafpile/example/index.html "Demo").
